# IGVer Optimization and AI Agent Development Task List

## Phase 1: Standalone Software Optimization (High Priority) âœ“ COMPLETED

### IGV Version Update
- [x] Update IGV from version 2.17.4 to version 2.19.5 in Docker container
- [x] Update Docker/Singularity container build with IGV 2.19.5
- [x] Test IGV 2.19.5 compatibility with existing batch scripts and preferences

### BED File Format Support
- [x] Add support for BED3 format input files (chr, start, end)
- [x] Add support for BED6 format input files (chr, start, end, name, score, strand)
- [x] Update CLI argument parsing to accept .bed files alongside .txt files
- [x] Implement BED file parser in igver.py to convert to internal region format

### Output Format Support
- [x] Add support for multiple output formats (.png, .svg, .pdf)
- [x] Implement SVG to PDF conversion using cairosvg
- [x] Test all output formats with test data

### Documentation and Testing
- [x] Update documentation and examples to include BED file usage
- [x] Update documentation for output format options

## Phase 2: AI Agent Development

### Core Agent Architecture (High Priority)
- [ ] Design AI agent architecture for genomics analysis workflows
- [ ] Implement natural language interface for genomics analysis requests

### Advanced Genomics Integration (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Add automated region-of-interest detection from VCF/variant files
- [ ] Integrate with common genomics file formats (VCF, GFF, GTF) for intelligent analysis
- [ ] Implement batch processing workflows for large-scale genomics projects
- [ ] Add quality control and validation features for genomics data

### Intelligence and Reporting (Low Priority)
- [ ] Create agent decision-making logic for analysis parameter optimization
- [ ] Implement reporting and visualization generation for genomics findings

## Progress Tracking

Use this checklist to track completion of tasks. Each completed item should be marked with [x] and dated.

## Notes

- Phase 1 tasks should be completed before moving to Phase 2
- IGV update to version 2.19.5 is critical and should be tested thoroughly
- BED file support will significantly improve usability
- AI agent development requires careful architecture planning
